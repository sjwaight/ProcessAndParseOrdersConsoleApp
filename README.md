# Sample C# .NET Console App

Sample console application written using .NET Framework 4.7.2 (it's what I had on my machine...) that will be used to demonstrate how to move .NET Console Apps developed in C# to Azure Functions.

This sample uses a slightly modified version of the publicly available [World Wide Importers sample database](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/wide-world-importers) for SQL Server.

The goal is not so much the actual work being performed, but that we are connecting to SQL Server to read and write data via a stored procedures.
